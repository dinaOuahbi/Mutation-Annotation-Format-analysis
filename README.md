# Mutation-Annotation-Format-analysis
Pancreatic cancer from TCGA

### Following a survival analysis using a deep learning model based on tile clusters (Multiple instance learning), we obtained a linear predictor that summarizes the contribution of these tiles in predicting the survival of pancreatic cancer patients.
### The linear predictor was then dichotomized on the Maxstat (http://www.sthda.com/french/wiki/maxstat-et-courbe-de-survie-pour-une-variable-continue-avec-rquery)

### This model considers HIGH as a group of patients with good prognosis

### Here, we will analyze the mutational data of these two groups of patients.

### Type and mutational load per patient and per group
